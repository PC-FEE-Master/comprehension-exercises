## This repo is a a good test of comprehension of basic syntax and more advanced concepts

### the progression for these exercises is as follows (in line with curriculum)

- data-access-primitives.js
- data-access-non-primitives.js
- operators.js
- objects.js
- primitive-methods.js
- non-primitive-methods.js
- conditionals.js
- conditionals-non-primitives.js
- loops.js
- functions.js
- functions-2.js
- functions-advanced.js
- array-methods-functional.js
- es6.js


### high level goal of this....

#### practicing all these principles with primitive and non-primitive values
    - each of these concepts should (if applicable)
    - include primitive examples like (string, boolean, null, undefined)
    - include non-primitive examples like (objects, arrays)

### an example of this (principle being conditionals statements)

```
// primitive example
const str = ''
if (str.length) {
 // set a variable to test or something...
}

// non-primitive example
const obj = {name: 'Jane'}
if (obj.name == 'Jane') {
    // set a variable to test or something...
}
```
